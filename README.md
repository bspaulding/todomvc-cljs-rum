Implementing TodoMVC in cljs with rum

## Overview

Just learning / playing with cljs here. Trying to be as "vanilla" as possible.

## Setup

To get an interactive development environment run:

    boot dev

and open your browser at [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/).
This will auto compile and send all changes to the browser without the
need to reload.

After the compilation process is complete, you can connect to the browser repl via:

    boot repl -c
    (start-repl)
    (js/alert "Am I connected?")

and you should see an alert in the browser window.
